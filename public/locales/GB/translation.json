        "1":"A translation works when the reader does not recognize it as a translation. That sounds easy but requires years of experience and the willingness to study every single day. I have been doing it for more than 20 years and every single day I discover and learn something new. Applying highest standards in spelling, grammar and style is only one aspect for high-quality translations that never ceases to inspire me."
